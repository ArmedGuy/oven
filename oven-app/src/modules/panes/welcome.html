        <p>
            Oven is a tool for creating and learning about microservices. It assists users in learning how to design microservices, and takes full care in deploying microservices to different microservices clusters.

        <p>
            By using incorporating a building-block-like coding experience with a regular code editor, it lets the users focus on building logic for their microservices rather than learning how to write boring boilerplate code.
